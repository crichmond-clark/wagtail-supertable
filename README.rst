Wagtail Supertable
====================

An extended version of wagtail table block using many of the handsontable features and also
adding options for richtext editor and other various features

NOTE: Supertable is an experimental FPF wagtail tool that we are building as open source in the hope that it might be useful to others.  If it proves to be successful, we may consider developing it into a full-featured wagtail plugin that is compatible with more use cases, but at present it remains an experiment.  We are open to potentially accepting contributions to add features or address certain outside needs, but it remains an internal tool first, and we can't guarantee that anything will be accepted.  Thank you.
